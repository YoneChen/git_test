				<p>Depends upon what client-side MVC framework you want use, Angular or Backbone or Ember and also are you a HTML lover.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>While using either EJS or Jade won't be problem with client-side MVCs, readability matters a lot in the long run.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Jade: Hated by HTML purists, many still find Jade difficult to wield because it moves away a lot from HTML.However Jade gives absolutely zero conflict with any of the client-side MVC enablers.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>EJS: If you are HTML purist, you'll love EJS because it allows you to code in HTML without conflicting with Angular. I personally love EJS because I'm a big Angular fan. However if you are a Backbone user you may not like it because there is some overlap in the syntax with Backbone which will confuse developers.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Other templates: Almost every other template engine like Mustache/Handlebar has some overlapping syntax with Angular or Ember, while this shouldn't be a problem because template engine kicks in before Angular/Ember, readability would be a pain.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Always remember the AGE OLD MANTRA of WEB DEVELOPMENT put forth by its father Tim Berners-Lee, "KEEP IT SIMPLE AND STUPID", to me EJS fits the bill because it is simple and stupid, and allows the code be readable. It also allows me to stick to HTML so I could work on Python frameworks too without having to relearn a lot. I also try my best to stay away from Python server-side template engines so I could use Angular as much as I can.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>This is personal choice however, so many developers don't recommend it.</p><br/>
